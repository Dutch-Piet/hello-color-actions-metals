This Code starts with "hello-color-actions" code used for MIT Cloud Dev/OPS (CC-ENG-020-Dec23) for Assign 4.2
the code is modified for use in Assignment 8.2 to do the following;

provide a custom "hello world greeting" (as in Assign 4.2) + the following;
 
1) This page fetches the commodity spot price from www.DailyMetalPrice.com. for the following metals used in a battery <br>
      - Copper (Cu)<br> 
      - Nickel (Ni) <br>
      - Zinc (Zn) <br>
2) The user can then transcribe those values into the calculator table and add the qty of each metal used in the battery. <br>
3) When the 'calculate' button is pressed, the table updates to compute extended costs for each metal and the grand total cost for the product.
